# Block Prototype - Recipe
This is a demo WordPress plugin used by me to test out concepts relating to building blocks. The plugin is used to try and understand official handbook recommendations.

It uses the `@wordpress/scripts` package and block.json and has a JSX editor interface with a server-side frontend.
